## Degree Program
BS Computer Science

## Key Takeaways
My key takeaways are that I learned how requests and responses are passed through different parts of the code and how important error validation is when it comes to sending data.

## Additional Notes
Make sure to run request.js to generate books.txt or else the GET method will not be tested properly, it can catch errors like missing files but to test it properly request.js must run first.
